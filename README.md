# WERE YOU BORN IN LEAP YEAR?

The objective of this project is to teach what is a leap year and check whether the User/Player was born in a Leap Year.

## FACTS about Leap year: 

You already know leap year is a year in which an extra day - 29 February - is added to our annual calendars. The 29 February is known as Leap Day and anyone born on this day is generally referred to as a Leapling.

But why to add extra 1 day in a leap year or need of Leap year?

It takes approximately 365.25 days for Earth to orbit the Sun â€” a solar year. We usually round the days in a calendar year to 365. To make up for the missing partial day, we add one day to our calendar approximately every four years.

This is how it is checked whether the year is a leap or not:
